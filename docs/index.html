<p class="header">Introduction</p>

<p>bbusb is a command line application which runs a user-provided list of commands and sends their output to a BetaBrite USB LED sign. Users are able to design their own <a href="scripts.html">functionality</a>, with bbusb acting as a simple but powerful conduit for transferring content to the sign.</p>

<p>bbusb is designed to work with all USB signs that support the BetaBrite protocol. Adding support for signs with serial interfaces should also be straightforward, since the protocol is effectively the same.</p>

<p>bbusb targets Linux machines using either libusb-0.1 or libusb-1.0, but it should also work on Windows with libusb-win32, which is equivalent to libusb-0.1.</p>
