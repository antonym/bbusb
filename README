THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED TO SOURCEHUT!: https://sr.ht/~nickbp/bbusb/

I'm consolidating my personal projects in one place. As such the old GitHub repo is being archived, and work now continues on sourcehut.

===

Building bbusb:

1) Install either libusb-1.0 or libusb-0.1
2) "mkdir build; cd build"
3) "cmake ../src"
4) "make"
5) See "build/bbusb"
